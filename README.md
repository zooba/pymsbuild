# pymsbuild

This is a PEP 517 backend for building packages via MSBuild.

# Configuration file

The file is named `_msbuild.py`, and is executed by running `python -m pymsbuild`.

The package definition specifies all the files that end up in the released packages.

```python
from pymsbuild import *

# Metadata is specified raw, but if an adjacent PKG_INFO file exists,
# such as in an sdist, it is preferred and this dict is ignored.
METADATA = {
    "Metadata-Version": "2.1",
    "Name": "package",
    "Version": os.getenv("BUILD_BUILDNUMBER", "1.0.0"),
    "Author": "My Name",
    "Author-email": "myemail@example.com",
    "Description": File("README.md"),
    "Description-Content-Type": "text/markdown",
    "Classifier": [
        "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha",
        "Intended Audience :: Developers",
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9",
    ],
}
PACKAGE = Package(
    "my_package",
    # Offset the package root from the _msbuild.py directory
    root="src",
    # Specify Python files directly...
    PyFile(r"my_package\__init__.py"),
    # ... or with a filename wildcard
    PyFile(r"my_package\*.py"),
    # Specify extension modules
    PydFile(
        "_accelerator",
        # Use a preconfigured project
        project_file=r"win32\accelerator.vcxproj",
    ),
    PydFile(
        "_accelerator2",
        # Include required files
        CSourceFile(r"win32\*.c"),
        CHeaderFile(r"win32\*.h"),
    ),
    # Subpackages nest inside other packages
    Package(
        "subpackage",
        PyFile(r"subpackage\*.py"),
    ),
)
```

# Usage

Rebuild the current project in-place.

```
python -m pymsbuild
```

Interactively generate the `_msbuild.py` file with project spec.

```
python -m pymsbuild init
```

Build the project and output an sdist

```
python -m pymsbuild sdist
```

Build the project and output a wheel

```
python -m pymsbuild wheel
```
